This is the fourth iteration of the Democracy frontend.

It is designed to be deployed on public clouds (not Heroku) like AWS, Azure, etc.

Uses typescript, axios, and rsuite.

The _Democracy_ project by _Small Minds_ is designed to:

1. Provide a secure and fair voting system for small elections.
1. Give election runners the ability to easily manage a set of open positions.
1. Give candidates a simple way to run for any given position.
1. Ensure election runners can restrict applicants by email domain.
1. Use simple email verification to ensure users are part of any given org.

## Contributing

When adding new features, please use the semantic commit style with these labels:

- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **perf**: A code change that improves performance
- **test**: Adding missing or correcting existing tests
- **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation

## Deployment

The following environment variables **must** be set in your deployment environment.

```
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=https://your-deployed-app.domain.com
REACT_APP_GA_KEY=UA-19230...
REACT_APP_SENTRY_KEY=https://09d854276f174...

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
